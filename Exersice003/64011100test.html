            only been able to be used by members of the royal family.
            <br>According to Marley's Titan Biology Research Society, the Founding Titan was the point where the paths
            connecting all Subjects of Ymir and Titans cross
            <br>Because of this, those who hail from Marley sometimes called it the "Coordinate" (座標 Zahyō).<br>

            <br>It was notable for its incredible size and its ability to control both the steam emitted by its Titan
            body and the amount of energy released during its transformations.
            <br>Although all Titans generated enormous amounts of heat and energy when transforming, the Colossus Titan
            took this to the next level. Its users could control the energy produced during their transformation to
            create various effects.
            <br>For instance, when Bertolt Hoover attacked Trost District his transformation only causes a wind blast
            that knocked some trainees over the Wall.

            <br>This armor was capable of shielding the Titan from significant amounts of damage, shielding direct hit
            from a cannon,
            <br>breaking ultrahard steel blades of vertical maneuvering equipment when struck and withstanding the
            Colossus Titan's explosive transformation.
            <br>The armor could be used for physical protection as well as offensively, dealing great damage upon impact
